## CONCEPT

- Get Together is a publicly accessible application that allows users from any given area to connect through event posting.
Similar to other social media apps, Get Together users will be able to post an event and update as necessary. The author of a post has the ability to update or delete an event if anything changes. The author will also be able to invite other users to their event via their username.
Users that are invited to the event can post comments that all other invited users can see and interact with. The idea here is that it allows the events to become adaptive and new ideas can be introduced from different users (ex: recommended food/drink, changing time/location). These new ideas would need to be implemented by the author of the post.
